A refreshing language for the front-end web.

Mint is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript

written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)

### Typed

Mint is a typed language. From components to HTML and CSS everything is type checked, which means virtually no runtime exceptions.

### Fast

Mint is fast. With incremental compilation it's usually under a half a second to reload the page, while automatically formatting the code.
