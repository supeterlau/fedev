        CONTENT: But, overtime, the blogging world has become a lot more saturated, which makes it much harder to stand out. Plus, these days, high quality imagery isn’t something that makes you stand out, it’s simply required and expected from readers. Plus with iPhones and editing apps, it’s too easy to get great photos, there’s no excuse for bad ones.
        So, how do you set yourself apart in the sea of bloggers?! Make your content as narrow and focused as possible. My initial reaction to this concept was “oh no, won’t I drive away a ton of people!?” and the answer is, maybe, but what you’ll gain is far better. You’ll lose some of the lurkers, the people who popped in a couple of times a month and don’t engage or buy, but you’ll get new followers who are highly engaged and interested in your content.
